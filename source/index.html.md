# Introduction

Hello reader!

Welcome to my little store of python learning. This is where i store my go-to content and i refer to this page often.

You will also find little tips and tricks to make coding in python easier.

If you enjoy browsing content from a newbie-peer, you will find this documentation helpful.

### Best practices for finding solutions

Learn to refer to the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for basic knowledge.

For a bite-size walkthrough of concepts, I recommended [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming).

Lastly, do it yourself! As you are going through the documentation, open up a terminal or python IDE and write the code snippets. Nothing beats learning than trying it yourself.
